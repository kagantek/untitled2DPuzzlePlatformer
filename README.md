This is a 2D platformer game that I have made for practice purposes using Unity game engine and C#. 

# How to play
In order to test the game you need to open the project in unity and get a build since GitHub doesn't push the builds file. 

# Controls
When the level starts you can press space to get your character moving, for each time that you want to jump you need to press space again. Enjoy!
